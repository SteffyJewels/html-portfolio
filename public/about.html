<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>What's Up Developers! My name is Stefanie Jones and Welcome to my Portfolio! Just a little about myself, I'm currently enrolled in a Web Development Bootcamp through Udemy and my ultimate goal, upon completion, is to finally full-filled a lifelong dream in becoming a web developer.</p>

<p>Lifelong you say? Why is that? Well I'm so glad you ask. Back in the days (around the year of 2000-2002), I just graduated from highschool the prior year and I decided to go to a community college all with the intentions of working in I.T. field. During those times (and before diving into the courses of the degree), we had to take these development classes in math, reading and writing. Once you passed these classes with the necessary grade, then you were able to dive into your actual degree courses. After taking a few courses under the Information Technology degree, I came across a course  called Application Problem Solving and I don't know what exactly what in this class made me switch but after this class, I switch my degree over to Multimedia Technology: Multimedia Web Design and started my journey in this field.</p>

<p>
Fast forward to 2024 and if you can guess it...I am not in the Web Development, e-commerce world. I did complete my degree in 2007 with an A.A.S in Web Design but due to the changing of the times, I wasn't able to pursue a career in this field. I guess you can say that the community colleges professors didn't properly prepared students to venture into the real world so I had to pursue a different path. I took several positions such as administrative assistant, receptionist or mail room clerk to pay the bills. It wasn't until I was at one of these jobs that I met a young lady and she saw potential in me. She wanted to show me what she did and because of her, is why I am in the field I am in today, 20+ years later. I'm currently working in the accounting field and just like one thing led me to another, I end up going back to school and pursue my A.A.S in Accounting.

<P>Thanks to online learning such as Udemy, I was able to dive into these skills that can help me, either better myself in my current job industry or help me change career path. Since I knew that I always wanted to be a web developer, I've learn that it's never too late to work hard toward that goal. That is what I hope to accomplish upon completing this bootcamp and I'm  so glad to share this journey I always wanted since 2000.</P>

<P>Welcome to the Show! </P>
